# This spread setup is used to test spread with spread itself. For that, the
# spread interpreting this file is assumed to be working based on prior
# testing, while the spread code being shipped to the remote server is being
# verified for correctness. See the tests to have an idea of how that's done.
# Keep in mind that the logic in task.yaml is supposed to test the *built*
# spread, not the one running the task.yaml logic.
